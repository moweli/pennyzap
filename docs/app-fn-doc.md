## **1. Core FIRE Projections**

### **1.1 Overview**

The **Core FIRE Projections** feature allows users to calculate the timeline to achieve Financial Independence and Retire Early (FIRE) based on their current financial situation and future assumptions. It provides a projection of savings growth over time and determines the required savings rate to meet their retirement goals.

### **1.2 Inputs**

Users are prompted to enter the following information:

1. **Current Age**

   - The user's current age in years.

2. **Target Retirement Age**

   - The age at which the user wishes to retire.

3. **Current Savings/Investments**

   - The total amount of savings and investments currently held.

4. **Annual Income**

   - The user's gross annual income.

5. **Annual Expenses**

   - The user's total annual expenses.

6. **Expected Annual Savings Rate**

   - The percentage of annual income the user plans to save.
   - Alternatively, this can be calculated based on income and expenses.

7. **Expected Annual Return on Investments**

   - The anticipated average annual return percentage on investments.
   - Default value can be set (e.g., 7% to reflect historical stock market returns).

8. **Inflation Rate**

   - The expected average annual inflation rate.
   - Default value can be set (e.g., 2%).

9. **Safe Withdrawal Rate**
   - The percentage of the portfolio the user plans to withdraw annually during retirement.
   - Default value can be set (e.g., 4%).

### **1.3 Outputs**

After processing the inputs, the app provides:

1. **Years Until Financial Independence**

   - The number of years it will take the user to reach their FIRE goal.

2. **Age at Financial Independence**

   - The projected age when the user achieves FIRE.

3. **Total Projected Savings at Retirement**

   - The estimated portfolio value at the target retirement age.

4. **Required Savings Rate**

   - The percentage of income the user needs to save to meet their retirement goal within the desired timeline.

5. **Graphical Projections**

   - **Savings Growth Over Time**: A line graph showing the projected growth of savings and investments each year until retirement.
   - **Net Worth vs. Time**: Visualization of net worth progression.

6. **Recommendations**
   - Suggestions for adjusting savings rate, retirement age, or investment returns to achieve FIRE sooner or more comfortably.

### **1.4 Business Logic**

#### **1.4.1 Calculating Annual Savings**

- **Annual Savings Amount**:
  \[
  \text{Annual Savings} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Expenses}
  \]
  - If the user provides a savings rate, it can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Annual Savings} = \text{Annual Income} \times \text{Savings Rate (\%)} \div 100
    \]

#### **1.4.2 Projecting Savings Growth**

- **Compound Interest Formula**:
  - The future value of investments is calculated using the compound interest formula, adjusted for annual contributions:
    \[
    \text{Future Value} = \text{P} \times (1 + r)^{n} + \text{PMT} \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^{n} - 1}{r} \right)
    \]
    - **P**: Current savings/investments
    - **r**: Expected annual return rate (as a decimal)
    - **n**: Number of years until retirement
    - **PMT**: Annual savings amount

#### **1.4.3 Adjusting for Inflation**

- **Real Returns**:
  - Adjust the expected annual return to account for inflation:
    \[
    \text{Real Return Rate} = \left( \frac{1 + \text{Nominal Return Rate}}{1 + \text{Inflation Rate}} \right) - 1
    \]
- **Inflation-Adjusted Future Value**:
  - Calculate the future value in today's dollars using the real return rate.

#### **1.4.4 Determining FIRE Number**

- **FIRE Number**:
  - The total amount of savings needed to retire, based on the safe withdrawal rate:
    \[
    \text{FIRE Number} = \frac{\text{Annual Expenses} \times (1 + \text{Inflation Rate})^{n}}{\text{Safe Withdrawal Rate (\%)} \div 100}
    \]
    - **n**: Number of years until retirement

#### **1.4.5 Calculating Years Until FIRE**

- **Iterative Calculation**:
  - Iterate year by year, increasing savings with contributions and investment returns until the projected portfolio value meets or exceeds the FIRE Number.
  - Stop the iteration when:
    \[
    \text{Projected Portfolio Value} \geq \text{FIRE Number}
    \]
- **Result**:
  - The number of iterations (years) gives the years until financial independence.

#### **1.4.6 Providing Recommendations**

- **Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Show how changes in savings rate, retirement age, or expected returns affect the timeline.
- **Optimization Suggestions**:
  - Recommend actionable steps, such as increasing savings by a certain percentage or adjusting investment strategies.
